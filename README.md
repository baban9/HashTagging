# HashTagging

This project entails two different objectives of tackling problems in the domain of Generative AI pertaining to NLP.

Firstly,

* hashtagApp
  * This app enables the users to input an RGB image and outputs a text information in the image.
  * The text input can be leveraged to generate hashtags for the image.
  * Additionally, the app also spits out 2 other variants of the image, black and white, and grey scale, which can further be used to augment as per the user use cases. for example, Upscaling of the quality of the image, remove background, etc.
* hashTag_community_analysis
  * This analysis is done on scrapped data from Instagram posts and a network from the connectivity of the hashtags, i.e, co-occurences, of them with each other.
  * We created a metadata as well as a small Network analysis, which can narrow down the hashtag search and gives the intuition of having more hashtags together to uplift the likes on the image.
